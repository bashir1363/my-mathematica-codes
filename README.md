README - Software Codes for Examples 3 and 4
--------------------------------------------------
The software codes for Examples 3 and 4 were provided for validation and reproducibility of the results reported in the manuscript.

1. Software Codes:
| Software Code | Example Number | Description                                           | Result Figure        |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Ex3           | 3              | Ten-story frame under harmonic base excitation       | Fig. 17 (a)        |
| Ex4-1         | 4              | Sloping frame solved directly using given damping values | Fig. 21 (a and b) |
| Ex4-2         | 4              | Sloping frame with load identified from known displacement at node B | Fig. 22           |

2. Instructions:
- Run the corresponding software code to reproduce the results for the specific example.  (Run in the Mathematica)
- Input parameters can be modified to study their effect on the results.
- Ensure that the software environment (Mathematica) is properly set up before running the codes.
- Refer to the comments in the code for additional guidance on using and modifying the programs.

3. Notes:
- The provided codes represent preliminary student versions.
- The results generated by these codes should match the figures indicated in the table above.
- Further improvements and a public version of the codes are planned as part of ongoing research.
